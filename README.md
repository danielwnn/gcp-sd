# Stable Diffusion on Google Cloud

## Overview
This repository serves as a comprehensive guide and resource for deploying stable diffusion models on Google Cloud's Vertex AI platform using GPUs and TPUs. 

## Why Use Vertex AI and Google Cloud?
Google Cloud's Vertex AI is a cutting-edge, fully-managed AI Platform that provides seamless integration with Google Cloud infrastructure. Leveraging Vertex AI's powerful compute resources, including GPUs and TPUs, allows us to accelerate the inference process and achieve real-time performance for our diffusion models.

## What You'll Find in this Repository?
1. **Step-by-Step Deployment Guide:** Our detailed guide takes you through the entire process of setting up and deploying stable diffusion models on Vertex AI. We provide clear and concise instructions, making it easy for both beginners and experienced users to follow along.

2. **Code Samples:** You'll find a collection of well-organized code samples written in Python, demonstrating how to preprocess data, train diffusion models, and deploy them on Vertex AI. These samples are designed to be easily adaptable for your specific use cases.

3. **Docker Files:** With the sample docker files to containerize models for training and inference jobs on GPUs and TPUs, you can follow the samples to optimize performance based on your model requirements.
